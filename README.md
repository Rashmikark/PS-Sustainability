Problem Statement:
AI-based image classification model to identify e-waste components for safe and sustainable recycling, reducing manual labor and environmental pollution.

DEFINITION OF PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Electronic waste — phones, computers, and circuit boards — is rapidly increasing, releasing toxic materials into the environment. Manual sorting is unsafe, slow, and inefficient. There is a need for an automated, accurate system that can identify e-waste items to support sustainable recycling and reduce human exposure.

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
Developed an AI-powered image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect components such as circuit boards, wires, batteries, and mobile parts.
The model automates e-waste identification, improving recycling efficiency, safety, and contributing to a circular, green economy.

📊 Week 1 Overview - Building the Foundation
Objective: Establish baseline performance with custom CNN architecture.

Approach: Built a 4-layer convolutional neural network from scratch with 19 million parameters, trained on 2,400 balanced images. Implemented data augmentation (rotation, shifting, flipping) and regularization techniques (dropout, batch normalization). The architecture included progressive filter sizes (32→64→128→256) to capture increasingly complex features.

Results:
•Validation Accuracy: 52.08%
•Test Accuracy: 33% (only 2 out of 6 test images correct)
•Training Time: ~2 hours on CPU
•Issue Identified: Significant overfitting - model memorized training data but failed to generalize

Key Learning: While the model learned basic patterns, a custom CNN trained from scratch requires either much larger datasets or more sophisticated techniques to achieve production-ready performance. This baseline established the need for transfer learning in Week 2.

🚀 Week 2 Improvements - The Breakthrough

Objective: Achieve 90%+ accuracy using advanced techniques.
Approach: Implemented transfer learning using MobileNetV2, a model pre-trained on ImageNet (1.4 million images). Instead of training from scratch, we leveraged pre-learned feature extraction and added custom classification layers. Training used a two-phase strategy: Phase 1 froze MobileNetV2 and trained only new layers (30 epochs), Phase 2 fine-tuned the last 30 layers with lower learning rate (20 epochs). Enhanced data augmentation added brightness variation and vertical flipping.

Results:
•Validation Accuracy: 95.33% (↑43.25% from Week 1)
•Test Accuracy: 91% (↑58% from Week 1)
•Training Time: ~1.5 hours (faster than Week 1)
•Confidence Scores: Consistent 81-100% (highly reliable predictions)
•Per-category accuracy: 91-100% across all 10 e-waste types

Key Improvements:
•Transfer Learning: Leveraged ImageNet knowledge instead of starting from zero
•Two-Phase Training: Systematic approach prevented overfitting while maximizing accuracy
•Better Generalization: Model performs consistently well on unseen test data
•Production-Ready: High confidence scores make it reliable for real-world deployment

Technical Achievement: Proved that transfer learning with systematic fine-tuning dramatically outperforms custom CNNs, especially with limited datasets.
