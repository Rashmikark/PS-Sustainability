Week 1 Problem Statement:

AI-based image classification model to identify e-waste components for safe and sustainable recycling, reducing manual labor and environmental pollution.

DEFINITION OF PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Electronic waste — phones, computers, and circuit boards — is rapidly increasing, releasing toxic materials into the environment. Manual sorting is unsafe, slow, and inefficient. There is a need for an automated, accurate system that can identify e-waste items to support sustainable recycling and reduce human exposure.

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
Developed an AI-powered image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect components such as circuit boards, wires, batteries, and mobile parts.
The model automates e-waste identification, improving recycling efficiency, safety, and contributing to a circular, green economy.

DATASET DESCRIPTION:
Source: Kaggle – E-Waste Object Classification Dataset
Classes: Circuit boards, cables, batteries, mobile and computer parts
Data Split: 70% Train | 15% Validation | 15% Test
Dataset includes real-world images with diverse lighting and backgrounds.

RESULT MEASUREMENT:
Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix.
Final Accuracy: ~92% on test data, showing strong capability to classify e-waste components reliably.

4-WEEK PROGRESS:

| Week | Task                        | Outcome                  |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1    | Collected & cleaned dataset | Ready for model training |
| 2    | Trained CNN model           | Achieved good accuracy   |
| 3    | Fine-tuned & tested         | Improved performance     |
| 4    | Built interface & report    | Working prototype ready  |

CONCLUSION:
This project shows how AI supports sustainability by automating e-waste sorting. It reduces human risk, improves recycling efficiency, and promotes eco-friendly waste management — a step toward a cleaner, smarter planet.
